# Composition Objects

Most blocks require a composition object as a child object. One of the very commonly required composition objects is the [Text Object](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/slack-block-msg-kit/blob/master/docs/CompositionObjects/Text.md).

- [Text](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/slack-block-msg-kit/blob/master/docs/CompositionObjects/Text.md)
- [Confirmation Dialog](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/slack-block-msg-kit/blob/master/docs/CompositionObjects/ConfirmationDialog.md)
- [Option](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/slack-block-msg-kit/blob/master/docs/CompositionObjects/Option.md)
- [Option Group](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/slack-block-msg-kit/blob/master/docs/CompositionObjects/OptionGroup.md)
